Why do we need JOIN 

Databases store data in separate tables to avoid repetition. 
JOIN connects those tables when you need combined information. 

Example 

Employee table → employee details 

Department table → department details 

JOIN helps you see which employee works in which department. 

 

Basic JOIN syntax 

SELECT columns 
FROM table1 
JOIN table2 
ON table1.column = table2.column; 
 

 

Common types of JOIN 

1️⃣ INNER JOIN 

Returns only matching rows from both tables. 

SELECT E.FirstName, D.DepName 
FROM Employee E 
INNER JOIN Department D 
ON E.Dnum = D.Dnum; 
 

✔ Only employees who belong to a department appear. 

 

2️⃣ LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN) 

Returns all rows from the left table, even if there is no match. 

SELECT E.FirstName, D.DepName 
FROM Employee E 
LEFT JOIN Department D 
ON E.Dnum = D.Dnum; 
 

✔ All employees appear 
❌ Department data is NULL if no match 

 

3️⃣ RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN) 

Returns all rows from the right table. 

SELECT E.FirstName, D.DepName 
FROM Employee E 
RIGHT JOIN Department D 
ON E.Dnum = D.Dnum; 
 

✔ All departments appear 

 

4️⃣ FULL JOIN 

Returns all rows from both tables. 

SELECT E.FirstName, D.DepName 
FROM Employee E 
FULL JOIN Department D 
ON E.Dnum = D.Dnum; 
 

✔ Matches + non-matches from both sides 

 

Simple real-life example 🏫 

Students table → StudentID, Name 

Courses table → CourseID, StudentID 

JOIN = Which student is enrolled in which course
